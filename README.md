# About me: 
I'm **Mark Damien Chinnasamy**, I am a recent Electronic Engineering graduate and I'm  currently exploring careers in Software development 
and Embedded systems engineering. I enjoy learning about hardware, microcontrollers, as well integrating them into practical software
applications. I have started learning courses in machine learning using tensorflow, and I am looking forward to learning how to deploy
that with in the programming architecture of an embedded system. 
  
There is still a lot I dont know , and a lot I want to learn about.
I think that GitHub will be a good place to document the highlights of my findings and experiences.

# Current Priority List:
Currently studying:
-Month 2 of Data Structures and algortihms
