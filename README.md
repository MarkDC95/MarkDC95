# About me: 
I'm **Mark**, I am a recent Electronic Engineering graduate and I'm  currently exploring careers in Software development 
and Embedded systems engineering. I enjoy learning about hardware, microcontrollers, as well integrating them into practical software
applications. I have started learning courses in machine learning using tensorflow, and I am looking forward to learning how to deploy
that within the architecture of an embedded system. Software engineering basics and computer Science fundamentals is where my main focus is currently.
  
I really want to learn how to develop software that is both functional, clean and scalable. I realised that I genuinely enjoy design especially 
if its a broadly defined problem. Programming feels both flexible and adaptaive but at the same time allows you to create a practical solution
or final product. I really do believe that this is my niche and its what I'm suppose to do, even if I did discover it a bit later in life.  
There is still a lot I dont know , and a lot I want to learn about. I think that GitHub will be a good place to document the highlights 
of my findings and experiences.

Hope you enjoy and be kind :)

### Acoustic Fault and Anomaly Detection  of Industrial Machinery Using ML â€¢ Honours Research and Design Project
[IEEE Published Conference Article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445053)
My research paper focuses on the domain of Acoustic Anomaly Detection (AAD) in industrial machinery using Deep Learning techniques. The primary objective of this study is to develop a reliable system for detecting anomalies in the acoustic patterns of industrial machines. In large-scale industrial environments, the early detection of faults and anomalies is critical to ensure the uninterrupted operation of machinery, minimize downtime, and optimize maintenance efforts. The datasets used in this research encompass a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) to simulate diverse operating conditions for industrial fans and pumps. After preprocessing each audio sample was transformed into 9 segments of shape 128 x 32 log mel-spectrograms. The study encompasses a comprehensive analysis of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) and Dense Autoencoders (DAE). These models are trained and evaluated against real-world industrial datasets (MIMII dataset), and their performance is meticulously compared. The results for the DAE and CAE had shown over 0.80 at the 6 dB SNR level and decaying results as the SNR level worsens. This research confirms some of the trends pointed out by the literature and provides detailed insight into how the autoencoders are developed and their properties could be used in order to detect anomalous behavior in audio data.
