# About me: 
I'm **Mark**, I am a recent Electronic Engineering graduate and I'm  currently exploring careers in Software development 
and Embedded systems engineering. I enjoy learning about hardware, microcontrollers, as well integrating them into practical software
applications. I have started learning courses in machine learning using tensorflow, and I am looking forward to learning how to deploy
that within the architecture of an embedded system. Software engineering basics and computer Science fundamentals is where my main focus is currently.
  
I really want to learn how to develop software that is both functional, clean and scalable. I realised that I genuinely enjoy design especially 
if its a broadly defined problem. Programming feels both flexible and adaptaive but at the same time allows you to create a practical solution
or final product. I really do believe that this is my niche and its what I'm suppose to do, even if I did discover it a bit later in life.  
There is still a lot I dont know , and a lot I want to learn about. I think that GitHub will be a good place to document the highlights 
of my findings and experiences.

Hope you enjoy and be kind :)
